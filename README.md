# lyrics-sentiment-analysis

In this analysis, I am using a top 100 billboard song lyrics dataset to review the sentiment of songs over the last 50 years. 

In this notebook, you will find:
* Sentiment Analysis using Vader and Sentiment analyzer from NLTK
    * The positive, negative, neutral, and compound scores are found for each song in the dataframe.
    * Feel free to explore this link to learn more about Vader: https://blog.quantinsti.com/vader-sentiment/
* Plots of the sentiment scores of the top 100 songs from each year for 50 years.
* Statistical testing (t-test) to find if there is a difference between the sentiments across the years.

## Note:
I do not take credit in the data collection of this dataset. I found this dataset in 2019. I did not have the hindsight to keep the link or note the location where I pulled this data.
